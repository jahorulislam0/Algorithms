/**============= Approach =================**

While solving http://www.spoj.pl/submit/HORRIBLE , I came across that comment by sicasli and was thrilled to know that BIT can be used for Range Update and Range Query also. I didn't understand his approach though. The following is how I thought about it and solved. Its some what tricky to explain the working of BIT in simple text, I'll try my best.
Similar to Range Update - Point query, we maintain a BIT (say B1)
- Add v to [a..b] --> Update(a,v) and Update(b+1,-v) on the BIT B1
- Query(p) on B1 now gives the correct value of A[p]

The answer we want is ( Sum(0..b) - Sum(0..a-1) ), so lets design Sum(0..p). The thing with BIT is,
if you design it to work for one update ( which is easy to imagine ) and all possible queries on that
one update, mostly it should work for multiple updates ;)

Lets consider just one update : Add v to [a..b], rest all are 0

Now, consider Sum(0..p) for all possible p

1. 0 <= p <  a : 0
2. a <= p <= b : v * ( p - (a-1) )
3. b <  p <  n : v * ( b - (a-1) )

This suggests that, for a index p, if we have (v * p) we can get the Sum(0..p) by subtracting X from it

1. 0 <= p <  a : v = 0, X = 0
2. a <= p <= b : (v*p) - (v*(a-1)), X = v*(a-1)
3. b <  p <  n : v = 0, X = - v*b + v*(a-1)

So, we need to maintain something else too, to get that extra X factor and that should give
0 for p < a, v*(a-1) for p in [a..b], -v*b+v(a-1) for p > b.
Does this ring something ;) ? hoho ! one more BIT for keeping this X factor.

We need to maintain another BIT (say B2)
- Add v to [a..b] --> Update(a,v*(a-1)) and Update(b+1,-v*b) on the BIT B2
- Query(p) on B2 now gives the extra sum that should be subtracted from A[p]*p
/**========================================**/


void update(int left, int right, int by) {
    internalUpdate(left, by, -by * (left - 1));
    internalUpdate(right, -by, by * right);
}
private void internalUpdate(int at, int mul, int add) {
    while (at < dataMul.length) {
        dataMul[at] += mul;
        dataAdd[at] += add;
        at |= (at + 1);
    }
}


int query(int at) {
    int mul = 0;
    int add = 0;
    int start = at;
    while (at >= 0) {
        mul += dataMul[at];
        add += dataAdd[at];
        at = (at & (at + 1)) - 1;
    }
    return mul * start + add;
}
